# 🤖 Agentic AI Learning Repository

Welcome to my curated learning repository on **Agentic AI systems**, covering modern frameworks, SDKs, tools, and real-world multi-agent implementations.

---

## 🎯 Objective

This repository is a structured learning hub focused on mastering:
- Autonomous AI agents using LLMs (Large Language Models)
- Tool use, memory, handoffs, guardrails, structured outputs
- Multi-agent orchestration via OpenAI Agents SDK, LiteLLM, and others
- Real-time applications like RAG, streaming, payments, and voice mode
